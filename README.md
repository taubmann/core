cms-kit
=======

cms-kit is a Framework for building your own Content-Management-Applications. 

Unlike normal Content-Management-Systems there is no predefined (Data-)Structure so you are completely free to build whatever you like.

## cms-kit features

* Data-Modeling: User defined content Classes and DBAL-Objects via build-in Code-Generator (no expensive MVC-Overhead)
* Hook-System to control nearly every Aspect of your CMS
* Multi-lingual Backend/Extensions (Locales managed by cms-kit itself)
* Support for multiple Databases per Instance
* Support for non-AutoIncrement-IDs
* [Wizards](//github.com/taubmann/cms-kit-wizards)
* [Extensions](//github.com/taubmann/cms-kit-extensions) like User-/Permission-Management, Version-Control, Workflow-Management, Web-Output etc. (everything is optional!)
* truly modular Architecture ([decoupled Content-Management](http://decoupledcms.org) at its best)
