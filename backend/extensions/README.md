# Extensions for cms-kit

Extensions are Packages containing Functions, Configurations and Documentations for [cms-kit](//github.com/taubmann/cms-kit)

They are placed in

* backend/extensions/
* projects/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/extensions/


I put them into a separate Repo to keep the Structure clean and simple.
