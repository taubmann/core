# Wizards for cms-kit

See [cms-kit](//github.com/taubmann/cms-kit)

Wizards are simple Folders with -at least- a File called index.php placed in backend/wizards/

Wizards are opened from Backend and are meant to support/ease some Editing-Tasks (such as editing HTML with a WYSIWYG-Editor).



I put them into a separate Repo to keep it clean and simple.
