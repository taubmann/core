# Wizards for cms-kit

See [cms-kit](//github.com/cmskit/core)

Wizards extend Backend-Inputs or provide Dialogs for easy Manipulation of Data

Each Wizard is a Folder containing (at least):

* include.php (include as embedded Wizard)
* index.php (open as Dialog)
* doc/
  * info.php (Settings to register the Wizard system-wide)
  * en/ (Folders for language-agnostic documentation)
  * ../
* ...
